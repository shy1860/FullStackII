# Student Solution Folder

* Create a directory with your student id
  * example mine is 100700400 so I would create a directory inside the students folder. I would do this by entering comp3133_full_stack/students and executing `mkdir 100700400` (replace my student id with yours)

* Once you've created your unique directory, create weeks 1-14. Check mine for an example
* In the root of the directory create a readme which includes your name and GitHub

> If you miss a submission date or somethings come up, please let myself or Mike know. We're here for you.

> The convention is the same as last year so it should be familiar but if you have any questions or Git isn't working [email me](jmorenstein@georgebrown.ca) and I'll help you get it sorted out.
