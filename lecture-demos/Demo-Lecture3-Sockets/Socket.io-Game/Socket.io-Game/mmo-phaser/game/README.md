# mmo-phaser-es6

This Repository is based off a different project: [basic-mmo-phaser](https://github.com/Jerenaux/basic-mmo-phaser) with thanks to [Jerome Renaux](https://github.com/Jerenaux).

This project here is a succesful attempt at refactoring before mentioned repository into ES2015.

## Starting your server
This skeleton uses webpack to turn your beautiful ES2015 code into something your browser understands, so before starting the server you should pack the code that is there by opening a terminal and typing:

```
npm run dev
```

Now you can start the server by typing:

```
npm start
```

This will serve your project at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
